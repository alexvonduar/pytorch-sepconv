# pytorch-sepconv
This is a reference implementation of Video Frame Interpolation via Adaptive Separable Convolution [1] using PyTorch. Given two frames, it will make use of <a href="http://graphics.cs.pdx.edu/project/adaconv">adaptive convolution</a> [2] in a separable manner to interpolate the intermediate frame. Should you be making use of our work, please cite our paper [1].

## setup
To build the implementation and download the pre-trained networks, run `bash install.bash` and make sure that you configured the `CUDA_HOME` environment variable. After successfully completing this step, run `python run.py` to test it. Should you receive an error message regarding an invalid device function during execution, configure the utilized CUDA architecture within `install.bash` to something your graphics card supports.

## usage
To run it on your own pair of frames, use the following command. You can either select the `l1` or the `lf` model, please see our paper for more details. In short, the `l1` model should be used for quantitative evaluations and the `lf` model for qualitative comparisons.

```
python run.py --model lf --first ./images/first.png --second ./images/second.png --out ./result.png
```
